# Experiment UI (Angular + Ant)

## Run UI:

### 1. Run server from https://github.com/sdbrother0/srv

### 2. Clone and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/sdbrother0/ui-ng-ant.git
cd ui-ng-ant
npm i
```

### 3. Change API_URL:

change API_URL in file: src/environments/environment.ts to your host
(e.g.: `http://localhost:8090` -> `https://sdbrother.org/api`)
```
export const environment = {
  API_URL: 'https://sdbrother.org/api'
};
```

### 1. Stop backend server (if running) and Build prod UI
```
ng build --c=production ui-ng-ant
```

### 2. Copy prod files to /var/www/html/ (nginx)
```
cp -r ./dist/ui-ng-ant/browser/* /var/www/html/
ln -s /var/www/html/index.csr.html /var/www/html/index.html
```

### 3. Nginx settings prod in file /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.

# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.
